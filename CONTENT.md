# About me

- Frontend developer expert, specializing in all things JavaScript
- Do a fair bit of backend and utility development in NodeJS, e.g. backend services, build tooling, etc.

# Career Path

## Union Pacific

- Started my internship at Union Pacific as a full time intern winter of 2013 (aka my last year)
- Learned an immense amount in my ~3 years at Union Pacific; great place to start my career
- Generally a great place to be and they do a lot of things right

## Object Partners

- Transitioned to a great consulting company called Object Partners, Inc.
  - Full stack consulants for a variety of clients and projects, including Best Buy, Target, Mutual of Omaha, TD Ameritrade, etc.
  - Of our graduating class of 9 CS majors in 2013, 3 have worked for Object Partners, and 2 currently work there (Cody and myself)

# What I wish I had known

## Programming in spare time

- I think I took my biggest professional leap when I began programming, reading articles, etc. outside of work and outside of class
- Some of you may already do this, and that's even better!
- Some of you may not, but there's still time to make this change
- reddit, twitter, and hackernews are great sources of information to stay current on tech trends/events
  - I am basically only a consumer/lurker on all of these (i.e. I rarely tweet, rarely post, etc.), but that's OK too!

## _Just_ Code

- This is not (necessarily!) building the next Facebook, but rather building something yourself and learning along the way
  - I've built so many dumb utilities and websites, just to learn
  - Have an approach of "Hey I could probably build that thing" and then build it
- Learn new languages
  - If you've only done Java, consider experimenting with Groovy or Kotlin, two languages that both compile to Java byte code
  - If you like JavaScript, check out TypeScript or Flow; both of which add types (like in Java) to JavaScript
- Open source it and put it on GitHub or GitLab
  - GitLab offers unlimited private repos if that's more your jam
  - GitHub is more visible

## Version Control Systems

- We just barely scratched the surface of SVN in my coursework here, but Git is more utilized in my experience (it's also way better)
- Some exposure prior to "on the job" learning just puts you in a better place when you will inevitably have to use these systems

## Testing

- We rarely discussed much testing, but writing tests for my code has sharply increased the overall code quality and reduced bugs
- If you're writing Java; Spock or JUnit are great choices
- If you're writing JavaScript; Jest is where it's at

# Job Search and Interview Advice

## Real-World Experience

- If you haven't already had an internship, definitely start that search and soon
- It gives you real world experience, which is incredibly valuable and a great compliment to your course work

## Go to Meetups

- Things like OJUG, NebraskaJS, etc.
- Great way to network and possibly open up some doors for yourself

## Don't Limit Yourself

- Gives you much more experience with the interview process
- Gives you leverage to negotiate a higher starting salary ($$$)
- Don't even limit yourself to just Omaha
  - Minneapolis, Kansas City, Des Moines are some awesome places and tech spots
  - Obviously West Coast or East Coast if that's more of your scene too

## Significant Projects

- Be able to talk about some projects you've done that you're proud of
  - If these are only course work, that's fine
  - Be prepared to talk in depth about these projects
- Interviewers really like people who are passionate and get excited about things, so have some projects in mind that you're passionate about

## Know what you don't know

- UP story
- During the course of the interview, if something was worded incorrectly or could have been worded more correctly, or if you just didn't know, mention this at the end
- Don't BS; if you don't know something, say you don't know but you will look into it after or soon

## Be yourself

- Easier said than done
- The interviewers want you to succeed
- They brought you in because they like you and your resume, so be you

## Thank You's

- Thank each interviewer for their time
- Send a thank you letter or e-mail to your main contact(s) who got you the interview or performed the interview

## Wrap Up

- I remember being incredibly nervous; college/class work was what I knew for the past 4 years
  - The transition to "real world" was daunting
- These nerves are normal
- Put yourself out there. interview at a bunch of places. be yourself. and it'll go great and you'll succeed beyond your wildest dreams
